                <p>
                    In this post we continue our journey of looking at popular <a href="https://trailedonline.com/choosing-the-perfect-overlanding-vehicle-for-your-next-adventure-here-are-the-top-picks-for-traild/"><u><b>overlanding vehicles</b></u></a>. Today our focus is on the Toyota tundra. If you’re looking for a capable and reliable vehicle that you can use for overlanding, then this makes for an excellent choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Tundra will give you a very strong build and has all of the features that you need to be able to take this overlanding. It will also hold up to all the demands that you throw at it that will allow you to tackle the trails, either as a beginner or an expert.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, you can make this even more of a beast by investing in upgrades – you can <a href="https://trailedonline.com/preparing-your-vehicle-for-overlanding-an-easy-to-follow-guide/"><u><b>read our post here on upgrades for overlanding</b></u></a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, we also recommend that you <a href="https://trailedonline.com/product/traild-6-gallon-spare-tank/"><u><b>pair this with the Trail’d tank</b></u></a>. This will eliminate any fears that you have with running out of water. You will be able to stack the tanks and you will also be able to carry as much water as you need without having to worry about sending the vehicle off balance.

                    What makes the Toyota Tundra a great choice for the trails?
                </p>
                <h2>Top Features Of The Toyota Tundra For Overlanding:</h2>
                <p>
                    Here are some of the best assets of this vehicle:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Robust Powertrain</b></li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    If you’re looking for power, then the Tundra will not let you down. This is one of the areas that you want to make sure that you have more than enough. If you are a complete beginner, you may not have to worry about power quite as much, however we recommend going for a strong engine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will find that the Tundra gives you a powerful engine and it also has a strong transmission that means you will be able to carry all of your gear and tackle any trail without any issues.
                </p>
                <ol start="2">
                    <li><b>Reliability</b></li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This is a major piece to the puzzle. Any vehicle that you take on the trails should give you something that is reliable. As you will be venturing into isolated parts of the map you need to make sure that the vehicle that you have is reliable and will not leave you stranded. The Tundra gives you a fantastic choice for reliability and peace of mind.
                </p>
                <ol start="3">
                    <li><b>Off-Road Capabilities</b></li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The Tundra is also designed for off-road; this means that you should have smooth navigation no matter which terrain you are trying to tackle. You also find that it comes with off-road packages and has features such as skid plates, off-road tyres and the differential lock which means that it should be able to tackle any terrain and allow you to have more fun doing so.
                </p>
                <ol start="4">
                    <li><b>Spacious Interior and Cargo Space</b></li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The Tundra is also a fantastic choice if you are going further afield for a longer time. You will find that it gives you a spacious interior and also has ample cargo space so you will be able to store everything from your camping gear to your supplies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you <a href="https://trailedonline.com/product/traild-6-gallon-spare-tank/"><u><b>pair this with the Trail’d tank</b></u></a> you will be saving even more space because it allows you to install the tanks in the spare tyre space. This will keep the vehicle balanced and it also means that you can carry far more water without taking up precious storage space.
                </p>
                <ol start="5">
                    <li><b>Towing Capacity</b></li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This is an added extra but a feature that we highly recommend. If you’re looking for a strong towing capability, then you will find that the Tundra will meet your needs here. This is essential if you wish to be able to carry heavy equipment and you should be able to use this to pull a camper, trailer or even extra supplies.
                </p>

                <h2>Trail’d Spare Tire Water Tank: The Perfect Complement:</h2>
                <p>
                    The <a href="https://www.toyota.com/tundra/?_gl=1*1k3zbpr*_gcl_au*MTExNDA5NzkxNS4xNzM0NTkzNTcz"><u><b>Tundra</b></u></a> is also a vehicle that is very popular amongst our customer base. When you have a vehicle that ticks off everything that you need for an overlanding machine, pairing this with a fast and convenient way to store water becomes a no-brainer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Trail’d water tank seamlessly integrates with the Tundra’s design, fitting perfectly where the spare tire is located. This design not only maximizes space but also ensures balanced weight distribution. The tank’s durable construction means it can handle rugged conditions, and its easy-to-use filling and dispensing mechanisms make accessing water a breeze.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you know that you need to take water with you, the Trail’d tank allows you to do this quickly and easily. It also gives you the benefit of not taking up any more cargo space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We <a href="https://trailedonline.com/product/traild-6-gallon-spare-tank/"><u><b>recommend checking out the tank</b></u></a> if you want to be able to have freshwater any time that you need it on your travels.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
                <p>
                    Overlanding is the ultimate adventure! To experience the great outdoors and the closest thing to how we used to live thousands of years ago.
